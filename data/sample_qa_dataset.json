    "question": "What is support vector machine?",
    "answer": "Support vector machine finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes in the data, maximizing the margin between classes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is k-means clustering?",
    "answer": "K-means clustering is an unsupervised algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters by minimizing the distance between points and cluster centroids."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is principal component analysis?",
    "answer": "Principal component analysis reduces data dimensionality by finding linear combinations of features that capture the maximum variance in the data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between batch and online learning?",
    "answer": "Batch learning processes all training data at once, while online learning updates the model incrementally as new data becomes available."
